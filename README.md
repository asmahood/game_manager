# Game Manager
Game Manager is a tool created for hockey referees to easily manage and track the amount of games they have completed over a season.

Currently, many referee associations use different game management software to assign games. This creates a problem for referees where tracking and counting games they have done over the season can become quite challenging. Managing three to four different schedules and keeping track of how much you should be paid is difficult.

While this problem could be solved using a spreedsheet, tracking multiple seasons can overwhelm the amount of data in the spreadsheet. This project aims to fix this problem and provide on-demand access to any number of games the user requests to see.

## Features
Some features of this project are:
- Displays total revenue made throughout a season
- View every game refereed by entering the game details into Game Manager
- Track the amount of games you have refereed in 2-Man, 3-Man, and 4-Man systems
- Remember who you've refereed with through partner tracking
- Sort games by association, level, or by position.

And more!
